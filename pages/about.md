## About the Collection

When traveling to London, there are so many places to visit. I created this guide of sorts to help you figure out a variety of areas that I recommend you go and see. I would also recommend a boat tour to really see a lot more of London that is harder to get to by just walking. Each place is (almost) walkable for the average person though. It is such a beautiful city. A majority of them are free, but the few that cost are worth the money.
